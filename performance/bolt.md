## 2024-05-20 - [Fixing App Double Render Cycle with ResultsView]
**Learning:** `App.tsx` undergoes a second render cycle whenever synonym data is fetched, because `addSearch` is triggered in an effect which sets local storage state, causing a re-render. Missing `useCallback` on `addSearch` triggered `App` updates. Without `React.memo` on the child component `ResultsView`, it would re-render uselessly when history updates, forcing expensive typography and DOM recalculations even if the definition data remains static.
**Action:** When a global state change occurs as a side-effect of data loading (e.g. updating recent history), always wrap returned custom hook functions in `useCallback` and wrap expensive display components like `ResultsView` in `React.memo` to shield them from the parent's secondary render cycle.
